# Runtime Map Overview

This project keeps long-lived state in `bot_impl/index.js` so that hot reloads can reuse context without reconnecting. The sections below summarise the key buckets that modules rely on.

## Shared State Structure

`state` is created by `prepareSharedState(...)` in `bot_impl/state.js` and lives across reloads. Important fields:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pendingGreets` | `Map<string, Timeout>` | Greetings scheduled for newly joined players. Cleared on spawn and reload. |
| `greetedPlayers` | `Set<string>` | Players already greeted this session. Prevents duplicate welcomes. |
| `greetZones`, `worldMemoryZones` | `Array<object>` | Hot-reload friendly description of greeting suffix zones (static + memory-derived). |
| `cleanups` | `Array<Function>` | Functions registered by modules to run on `deactivate()`; see `registerCleanup`. |
| `externalBusy` / `externalBusyCount` | `boolean` / `number` | Gate for autonomous features to yield while a player-initiated tool is running. Incremented/decremented via `external:begin` / `external:end`. |
| `currentTask` | `object|null` | Lightweight descriptor of the action the bot is performing (tool name, source, start timestamp). Shown in status CLI and reset on completion. |
| `autoLookSuspended` | `boolean` | Hint for visual modules (e.g., fishing) that they have temporarily claimed camera control. |
| `loginPassword` | `string?` | Optional cached server password used by `auto-login`. |
| `aiRecentReplies` | `Map<string, number>` | Tracks recent AI replies to avoid greeting someone immediately after chatting with them. |

All collections are normalised (`Map`/`Set`/`Array`) each time `activate()` runs so modules can depend on consistent shapes.

## Event Hooks

| Event | Handler | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `external:begin` / `external:end` | Marks `state.externalBusy` and updates `state.currentTask`. Modules should respect `state.externalBusy` before starting background work. |
| `spawn` | Greets players, rebuilds greeting zones, runs one-shot scripts. |
| `death` / `respawn` | Force reset of automation and announce interruption to users. |
| `message` | Mirrors server chat to stdout with log truncation. |

## Module Registry

`bot_impl/module-registry.js` lists every hot-reloadable module with its path, logger namespace, and a brief description. `index.js` iterates over this registry when installing modules, so adding or removing functionality only requires editing one place.

## Tool Metadata

`bot_impl/actions.js` exposes `TOOL_NAMES` (the full allowlist for AI-exposed tools). Run `node scripts/list-tools.js` to output the names as JSON. This keeps documentation and prompts synchronised with the runtime registry.

Keeping these snapshots up to date helps both humans and AI contributors understand the current surface area without reading every module manually.
